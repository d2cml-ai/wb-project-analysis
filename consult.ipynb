       "[Document(page_content=\"B. Project Components 34. The project will comprise five components:66 Component 1: Inclusive broadband connectivity (Estimated IBRD financing: US$66 million) 35. This component will finance broadband infrastructure to reach unconnected localities which currently lack digital infrastructure and remain unserved by the private sector. In Argentina, there are about 1,500 localities with no access to internet, which often lack the infrastructure linking them to the backbone network’s nodes, leaving around 530,000 people offline.67 This project will bring internet access68 in unserved and underserved localities69 by deploying infrastructure that links these localities to the backbone network. Beneficiary localities will be selected by assessing their proximity to the backbone network’s nodes70 and the energy power supply and poles/ducts, together with an analysis of their socioeconomic71 and geographic features. 36. Subcomponent 1.1: Broadband connectivity infrastructure. Funds will be allocated to a specific segment of broadband infrastructure in areas not profitable for the private sector and that – as a result – are left unserved, creating a market failure. The approach will be designed to mobilize private finance; for instance, exploring the option of reverse auction mechanisms for network deployment. At the same time, the infrastructure financed by this operation will increase the incentives to market players to serve final users. This subcomponent will finance, among other items: (a) the required investments to deploy wholesale broadband local infrastructure linking unconnected and underserved localities to the backbone network’s nodes; and (b) the equipment in end users’ 64 Data infrastructure includes the facilities to collect, exchange, store, process, and distribute modern data because of its digital character. WB World Development Report, 2021. 65 Outage time refers to a period of time that a system fails to provide or perform its primary function. 66 The numbering of the components in the Project Appraisal Document does not indicate their sequencing. Activities can be running in parallel. 67 Backbone network is the infrastructure that provides local, regional, and international connections for voice and data. It forms the backbone of data traffic. Significant Capital Expenditure (CAPEX) and low returns to investments make their connection unprofitable for the private sector. 68 Following International Telecommunication Union (ITU) definition, internet access refers to household access to ICT equipment and services, not to use of those products by individual household members. https://www.itu.int/en/ITU- D/Statistics/Documents/publications/manual/ITUManualHouseholds2020_E.pdf. 69 As a result of the project, every individual living in the target localities would be given access to the internet. 70 This includes fiber backbone owned by ARSAT, regional public networks owned by the provinces (i.e., a Public Limited Company with Majority State Participation or Sociedad Anónima de Participación Estatal Mayoritaria - SAPEM), and private carriers. Localities - with both private and public transport nodes – and within 20km distance from the networks, may be prioritized in the project scope together with other factors (e.g., socio-economic factors). 71 The selection process will prioritize localities with higher economic potential (e.g., national parks). Page 16 of 91 The World Bank Strengthening data infrastructure to close the digital gap in Argentina Project (P178609) premises (e.g., drop link, local modem, optical network terminal, and access point).72 Finally, the project will prioritize renewable energy solutions (e.g., wind power and battery storage) to power the financed infrastructure while requiring compliance in all investments with ‘Green ICT Standards’73, which include mitigation activities such as energy efficiency and e-waste management, and a high resilience to climate shocks.74 37. The model for delivering connectivity is based on the establishment of a wholesale local infrastructure following the principles of technology neutrality, open access, and competition. Technical and financial feasibility studies will determine which technology (wireless, fixed, satellite) is the most efficient to bring connectivity to the selected localities. The open access75 operation aims to be an innovative model to promote the ISPs and local cooperatives' participation in providing broadband services to end users, removing entry barriers to small players in the market (i.e., Capital Expenditures – CAPEX - requirements, risks), and promoting efficiency in network deployment and operation. Finally, the principle of competition means that the infrastructure will be deployed and operated by an entity selected under a transparent procurement public process.76 38. This component will secure broadband connectivity to localities under affordability and sustainability conditions. In line with the principles of open access and competition, access to the infrastructure financed by this project may be subject to measures to prevent anticompetitive behaviors. Such an approach will prevent market power abuse and high tariffs for the final users. 39. Subcomponent 1.2: Technical assistance. This will include, among other items: (a) feasibility studies, covering both technical and environmental and social impact; (b) public tender structuring; and (c) technical, regulatory, and financial consultancies, as needed, to support project implementation. Component 2: Resilient data infrastructure (Estimated IBRD financing: US$120 million) 40. This component will finance a decentralized network of data centers and a High-Performance Computing (HPC) platform to strengthen the country’s data infrastructure efficiency and resiliency, including to climate change impacts. This will add new capabilities and utility, including bringing processing and performance closer to end users in regional or non-central locations; the ability to create collection points for data sources, including Internet of Things (IoT) and e-government transactional data; etc. 41. Subcomponent 2.1. Data centers. This subcomponent will finance four additional data centers, complying with international cybersecurity, climate resilience, and energy efficiency standards. The Project will assess and develop different strategies for the establishment of a decentralized network of data centers linked to the existing Tier 3 ARSAT data center located in Benavidez (Buenos Aires).77 The facilities will be built following a 72 The financing of the equipment on end users’ premises will be evaluated on a case-by-case scenario and installed only for those users requiring the provision of the internet service. 73 ITU-T, Green ICT Standards and Supplements. https://www.itu.int/net/ITU-T/lists/standards.aspx?Group=5&Domain=28. 74 Details on climate activities can be found in ANNEX 5: Climate Change Technical Note. 75 The open access principle entails a model in which one entity deploys and operates the passive and active layer building a network over which all service providers can deliver their services. The passive layer includes the physical infrastructure to support telecommunications equipment implementation and interconnection such as towers, poles, optical fiber cable, cabinets, splitters, etc. The active layer includes telecommunications equipment such as wireless base station, Optical Line Terminal, routers, switches, power system, etc. 76 This process must comply with the principles of openness, transparency, neutrality, equality, prevention of corruption and money laundering as well as consider principles included in the legal framework for PPPs in Argentina and specific sector regulations. 77 Supported by the Digital Inclusion and Innovation in Public Services in Argentina Project (P174946) Page 17 of 91 The World Bank Strengthening data infrastructure to close the digital gap in Argentina Project (P178609) demand and technical assessment to finance a medium-sized data center and three small facilities around the country, with specific locations78 to be defined based on technical and climate vulnerability criteria and resiliency standards.79 The decentralization of the country’s data infrastructure will enhance resiliency and safety, preventing data losses in cases of external shocks, such as climate events, and therefore increasing adaptation to climate change. Decentralization will also support emerging technologies and services such as IoT data aggregation and edge processing, further supporting process automation and multiagency decision support. 42. The data centers will be self-contained modules or containers that will be installed on available government sites. The modules considered have the basic infrastructure distribution included (energy, cooling, networking) and need the external connections to secured energy, network, and water supply. Each module will have general cloud services available, HPC capabilities, and local storage. 43. This subcomponent will follow the principles of open access and technological neutrality. Different operative models and technical specifications will be assessed with the objective of promoting and ensuring open access and identifying the most adequate technologies. For instance, data center infrastructure may consider all potential ownership and operations models, which include (but are not limited to): (a) Government owned and operated; (b) Colocation of data center facility in commercial facility, Government owns and operates IT equipment and infrastructure; (c) Data center facility and IT equipment (including cloud computing resources) outsourced to the private sector, government management of information systems; and (d) PPP and outsourcing of data center, cloud, and some information systems management. 44. Data center design will follow climate smart practices, ensuring resilience and efficiency and prioritizing renewable energy sources. Well-designed data centers require prioritizing energy efficiency and scientific management of cooling and heat removal. IT efficiency needs to be combined with other design factors such as geolocation selection, power distribution efficiency, IT space layouts, and airflow. All these have a major impact on data center energy consumption.80 This component will prioritize utilization of renewable energy sources that could act as a backup in case of electricity outages (batteries charged by renewable energy generation). Additionally, they could supplement data center non-IT equipment power demand with renewable energy sources for non-IT space (e.g., lighting, utility outlets), consuming from their own installations instead of from the utility grid. This will improve energy efficiency and mitigate the impact on utility facilities and distribution lines. The project scope includes exploring the option of agreements with power suppliers to provide energy from renewable sources - mainly hydroelectric and wind power - to be fulfilled through the CAMMESA national grid.81 45. The need for additional data infrastructure will be satisfied minimizing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and promoting energy efficiency. Firstly, the establishment of additional data centers will be aligned with international standards on green procurement.82 This will make it possible to promote ICT system performance, mechanical and electrical system performance, and reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. At the same time, 78 The location of the data centers will be exclusively on unoccupied and accessible public land, avoiding expropriations, displacements or relocations, and promoting accessibility for those with disabilities. 79 CIRSOC norms, https://www.inti.gob.ar/areas/servicios-industriales/construcciones-e-infraestructura/cirsoc 80 A poorly designed data center uses much more power to drive IT equipment than a well-designed data center. This can mostly be attributed to the cost of cooling and heat removal. 81 https://cammesaweb.cammesa.com/inicio-renovables/. Argentine Wholesale Electricity Market Clearing Company (Compañía Administradora del Mercado Eléctrico Mayorista, CAMMESA) 82 See for instance, Development of the EU Green Public Procurement (GPP) Criteria for Data Centres, Server Rooms and Cloud Services. Page 18 of 91 The World Bank Strengthening data infrastructure to close the digital gap in Argentina Project (P178609) these additional facilities will enable communities to adjust and prepare for climate change consequences. They will provide the storage and computing power to monitor and forecast weather, but also develop alerts and response plans to climate change events. These activities will increase local climate resilience, which will be more impactful for vulnerable populations, the most affected by climate-related disasters. 46. Subcomponent 2.2. High-Performance Computing (HPC) platform. This platform will be deployed throughout the network of data centers - within the scope of this project - to distribute the data flows acquisition and decentralize the computation and generate an efficient use of storage and network resources.83 It will include the expansion of the Benavidez Data Center both in available space and in information technology (IT), consisting of: (a) provision of energy (both main and stand-by, medium voltage transformers, uninterruptible power supplies (UPS), and automation), cooling and heat removal, fire detection and suppression, physical security and cybersecurity, networking, and management / monitoring systems in one existing room in Benavidez; (b) servers and storage equipment necessary to implement Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) base services; and (c) implementation of virtual and cloud computing resources. The team will assess best international experiences in HPC operative models to leverage all the potential of such a facility. The main investments in the existing Tier 3 ARSAT data center Benavidez and the future medium-sized data center built within this project are under evaluation. Technical assistance will be provided to define the data center and HPC operating models based on international principles, experiences, and standards. 47. Subcomponent 2.3. Technical assistance. This subcomponent will include, among others: a) technical assessment of a decentralized network of data centers;84 b) demand assessment for data centers; c) technical assistance for the public sector cloud migration strategy; d) technical assistance to support the strengthening of the enabling laws and regulations on data protection, cybersecurity (including combatting cybercrime), and related issues to promote trust to enable the Argentine digital economy and safeguard the rights of individuals; e) cloud computing, and data infrastructure; and f) technical and financial consultancies to support project implementation. Component 3: Digital skills (Estimated IBRD financing: US$10 million) 48. This component aims to strengthen digital skills to better equip individuals and businesses across Argentina for the jobs and economy of the future and to adapt to online activities. The development of digital skills is a critical step toward moving basic functions online and minimizing disruption of education and health services in the event of climate-induced disasters and other external shocks such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Beneficiaries of this component are on both the demand and the supply side. On the one hand, the local IT industry will rely on new and highly skilled professionals in the labor market. On the other, individuals will have the opportunity to advance their digital skills and access a more sophisticated digital ecosystem. This can bring 83 The HPC platform will be developed within the data centers financed by the project and subject to the same energy and sustainability standards. 84 The team will leverage the Quality Infrastructure Investment Partnership funds to review and identify different data centers’ operational models. Page 19 of 91 The World Bank Strengthening data infrastructure to close the digital gap in Argentina Project (P178609) changes in gender equality through women-targeted trainings. Digital skills are also essential for women and underserved groups so that they are not left behind in an increasingly digitalized economy. 49. Subcomponent 3.1. Digital skills development. This subcomponent will support collaboration with local partners, universities, tech incubators, operators, and local administrations to develop and deploy technical and professional education programs in newly connected localities (linked to Component 1) and to support the uptake of services that will be provided by the data centers (linked to Component 2). Activities will consider, among others, solutions for and impacts on climate change adaptation, disaster risk management, and gender inclusion. Applying a gender lens in the design of this component and leveraging existing government initiatives aimed at more equitable gender inclusion in the ICT sector will help the team identify training opportunities tailored to women to support their increased participation in the digital economy.85 The training programs will include specific targets to encourage maximum participation of women and girls to promote greater opportunities for them in digitally enabled professions and businesses, and also target vulnerable populations such as indigenous communities, Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender and Intersex (LGBTI+), afro-descendants, and people with disabilities. This subcomponent will finance, among other items, (a) provision of training to strengthen IT technical and managerial skills of persons living in newly connected localities and potential users of services provided by data centers; (b) capacity-building and skill-development activities targeting civil servants to ensure the full realization of the digital government transformation agenda, including specifically staff that have the mandate for collecting and disseminating emergency alerts and warnings and managing risk data (Disaster Risk Management); and (c) supporting the design and implementation of digital skills trainings for the use of digital technologies applied to agriculture and/or livestock to promote efficiency and adaptation to climate change. 50. Subcomponent 3.2. Coordination and articulation of digital skills ecosystem. This subcomponent is anchored in establishing partnerships with academics, global and domestic alliances, and the private sector to foster the digital and IT ecosystem around the country and establish minimum contents and standards for digital competency certifications. The strengthening of the ecosystem of digital and IT staff and firms around the country will especially benefit localities with new connectivity and regions with new data centers. This subcomponent will finance, among other items: (a) technical assistance for the establishment of digital competency certifications; (b) technical assistance to design dedicated programs for the development of IT capabilities focused on women, people with disabilities, and vulnerable groups; (c) carrying out of trainings and workshops, seminars, and networking events; and (d) provision of operating costs (e.g., transport stipends) and flexible training programs to promote and increase women’s attendance. 51. Subcomponent 3.3. Digital skills trainings implementation support. To foster digital uptake, the subcomponent will provide equipment, software, and additional specific assistance to support the design, test, and/or implementation of digital skills trainings. 85Centros de Género en Tecnología (G+T), is an initiative by the SIP (Secretaría de Innovación Pública) bringing together the public sector, private ICT companies, and civil society organizations to strengthen their programs and initiatives to reduce the gender gap in the digital and tech-related sector in Argentina. The activities include awareness-raising campaigns, capacity-building, trainings and advocacy through workshops and working groups. Page 20 of 91 The World Bank Strengthening data infrastructure to close the digital gap in Argentina Project (P178609) Component 4. Project management and evaluation (Estimated IBRD Financing: US$4 million) 52. This component supports project management and institutional capacity building for implementation and sustainability, leveraging the Government’s existing resources and institutional structures. The component focuses on support for the Directorate of Sectorial and Special Programs and Projects (Dirección de Programas y Proyectos Sectoriales y Especiales, DIPROSE) to manage and implement the project activities. Activities under this component include among other items: (a) support for overall project management, including project coordination, change management, and project monitoring and evaluation (M&E) capabilities to strengthen DIPROSE; (b) capacity building and technical support to the SIP in its mandate to design and initiate data infrastructure initiatives in order to inform project implementation and supervision and long-term sustainability of the project’s interventions; and (c) carry out project strategic evaluation activities in coordination with the Ministry of Economy through the Undersecretariat of International Financial Relations for Development, which is responsible for technical-methodological advice. Component 5. Contingent Emergency Response Component - CERC (Estimated IBRD Financing: US$0 million) 53. This component is a contingent financing mechanism available to Argentina to have immediate access to Bank financing to respond to an eligible crisis or emergency, defined as “an event that has caused, or is likely to imminently cause, a major adverse economic and/or social impact associated with natural or man-made crises or disasters.” The mechanism for the triggering of the CERC would be established in the CERC Manual, detailing the applicable fiduciary, environmental and social, monitoring, reporting, and any other implementation arrangements necessary for the implementation of the proposed activities to be financed. In case of an eligible event, a reallocation of funds would be introduced to loan disbursement categories to fund the proposed activities under this component in order to be able to respond to the emergency. The implementation agency for this CERC would be determined in accordance with a CERC Manual.\", metadata={'url': 'http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/099030011152239001/pdf/BOSIB1dedfde1710df9141f3192fa15ec716f7f697.pdf'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='A. Project Components The proposed Fiji Connectivity Project is closely linked to the ongoing Samoa Connectivity Project (P128904). The Project will finance the incremental costs of the extension of the SSCC cable to Savusavu on Vanua Levu Island in Fiji, and the installation of terrestrial equipment to achieve an operational Suva to Savusavu cable system. This Project also includes institutional development components to ensure that the cable is able to deliver services to the widest possible population at the lowest possible cost. The Government of Samoa/SSCC have already commenced procurement for the SSCC cable, through a competitive process, with the Savusavu connection provided for as an “extended configuration” to this main cable system. The SSCC is targeting the cable to be ready for service in Samoa by August 2017. This requires that complementary works for the Savusavu extension commence by Q4 2016 calendar year, entailing some retroactive financing if expressly approved by the board. The Savusavu extension is expected to be completed in Q4 2017 calendar year, and the monitoring of Project‐related benefits and impacts will continue through 2021. Project components are summarized below: Component 1. Submarine Cable System (US$5.2 million), comprising the following elements: a. Design, supply and installation of a submarine optical fiber cable to connect Vanua Levu to the main SSCC cable, including a marine survey, a cable manufacture and cable deployment. b.
